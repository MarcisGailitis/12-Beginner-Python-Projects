Create an algorithm, where computer never loses using Minimax.

- you maximize your win
- opponent minimizes their loss

Where algorithm tries to find the best move to take, by trying out every move to find which one is the most optimal, through utility function, which is a measurement of how valuable the final result of that tree is.

Utility function:

- ix x wins: then 1
- if o wins: then -1
- multiplied by: remaining squares + 1
